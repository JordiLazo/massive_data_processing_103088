My first guess is that the interval censoring would be disjoint, i.e. [0, 10k) [10k, 20k), etc. What would be a little disappointing to me is if there were no overlapping intervals (i.e. subject 1 = [10k, 50k), subject 2 = [25k, 100k), etc.).

To be clear, the reason that extracting data from PDFs is relevant to open data is that there is a massive amount of data that is *only* available in PDF files.
